    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have 6 years of experience working in the european energy trading business. Currently, I am working in the Augmented Trading Community at enspired in Vienna.
      Since my studies I have always been very passionate about the energy trading business, especially about the short-term trading markets.
      Because of working with large amounts of data in fast-paced markets, my interests in data science and machine learning grew and I finished a part-time masters degree in Data Science.
      I am very interested in contributing to a sustainable and reliable energy supply in Europe.
      Outside of work, I am doing a lot of sports. Previously I have played football in Austria and Germany. Now I am spending a lot of time in the nature. Running, hiking in the mountains, cross-country skiing in the winter-months and I'm still interested in trying out new activities.
      Travelling and exploring new countries and cultures are my passion.
